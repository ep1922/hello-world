# hello-world
Trying to get a little more familiar with coding.
I am an intern working with the Engineering Department of a utility provider as a GIS Technician/ Analyst. 
During the last couple of weeks of my internship we have been looking into java programming in order to become more familiar with the concept. This is due to the fact that ESRI is starting to move things into the JAVA and HTML5 world.
